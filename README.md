### Project Description
```
This project has been developed to manage movie reviews. 
To make the most of the various functionalities it offers, 
we recommend following these steps:

1. Set up the backend
2. Register your user
3. Log in
4. Register a movie
5. Register a rating and comment
6. Edit a movie
7. Delete a movie

In this project, we have implemented validation for unique users, 
which means there cannot be duplicate users or email 
addresses in the system. When a user logs in, a security token 
is generated that allows access to the movie section. In this 
section, users can perform various actions such as registering 
new movies, updating existing movie information, deleting movies, 
and adding ratings and comments to them.

Movies are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, and these 
ratings are averaged with the total number of ratings each 
movie has received.

This provides an overview of the quality of each movie 
based on user opinions.
